A Bill of Materials file is a tab-seperated list of the components reference, Quantity, Value, Part, Footprint, Description, Vendor

[One Click BOM](https://kitspace.org/1-click-bom/) is a plugin that uses your BOM `.tsv` file to automatically order the correct components for your project, share information when open sourcing a project so others can make their own version.

If you ever get to the point of wanting to make and ship thousands of your amazing project, you may want someone like [European Circuits](https://european-circuits.co.uk/) to help assemble them. The first thing they will ask for is your Bill of Materials. Getting into the practice of documenting this alongside all your schematic files and artwork could save you alot of time later.
