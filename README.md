# My First PCB

So you've been building up circuits on a breadboard for a while now, and maybe soldering some of them onto stripboard, but want to make them look nicer and be quicker and easier to solder?  You need to design your own printed circuit boards!

It's easier than you think.

Start off by running through the basics in [Designing an LED Throwie](DesigningAnLEDThrowie) and then choose your own route through the remaining tutorials based on what you're looking to build.

## Lessons

 * [Designing an LED Throwie](DesigningAnLEDThrowie).  The basics, from breadboard to ordering PCBs.  **DO THIS ONE FIRST**
 * [Adding Artwork](AddingArtwork).  Every board deserves a logo!
 * [Making Footprints](MakingFootprints) or "I want to use a part that isn't in the library!"
 * [Now Available In 3D](NowAvailableIn3D).  Making 3D models of your board (and creating 3D models for parts without them)
