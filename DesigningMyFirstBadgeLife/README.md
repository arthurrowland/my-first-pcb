# The Basics - Designing an LED Throwie

## 1. Installing Kicad

Download the latest stable version of Kicad for your operating system from the [Kicad downloads page](http://kicad-pcb.org/download/).  You should make sure it is at least v5.1.5 (that's what all the example files are saved as, if you want to compare them)

## 1. Build the schematic

1. Open Kicad
1. Choose `File` -> `New` -> `Project...` and give it a name

1. Double-click on the schematic file `.sch`.  The first time you run Kicad it might ask you to "Configure Global Symbol Library Table".  Choose the recommended option.


## 1. Footprints and netlist
