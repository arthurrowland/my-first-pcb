### Learn how to make your first Printed Circuit Board (PCB)!

Design a printed circuit board to get you started in the world of electronics design and small scale manufacturing. Designed to give you an understanding of some basic fundamentals in electronics production with [KiCad](https://kicad-pcb.org/) using [MCQN Ltd](https://mcqn.com/)'s experience designing and developing products, systems and the Internet of Things. Everything from cufflinks, dust sensors, Museum installations and internet connected bells and bubble machines.

 * Maybe you've been building up your own circuits on a breadboard for a while now, and maybe soldering some of them onto stripboard, but want to make them look nicer.
 * You want things to be more robust, professional and safe to help with product development or your own systems.
 * You've seen designs on the internet and need help to make it or adapt it yourself. You need to design your own printed circuit boards!

### It's easier than you think.

Start off by running through the basics in [Designing my first #BadgeLife](DesigningMyFirstBadgeLife) and then choose your own route through the remaining tutorials based on what you're looking to build.

## FAQs 🙋

### Do I need any previous experience?📜

You'll need to have some experience building and prototyping simple electronic circuits using low voltage batteries and breadboards. You may have built some basic [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) projects or experimented with powering or controlling LEDs or other electronics. You may have already built simple electronic sensors and now want to make more robust custom 'breakout' boards.

You'll use practical workshop notes, references and resources and a chance to share your ideas with fellow electronics enthusiasts and creatives while introducing you to the facilities and other members of the DoES Liverpool community.

### Venue 🏭

We are running the course at [DoESLiverpool](https://doesliverpool.com), so find out more about the location on their [wiki page](https://github.com/DoESLiverpool/somebody-should/wiki/Location)

### COVID-19 😷🧼👏
We will be monitoring the new lockdown restrictions so can advise closer to the time if we will be able to run the course in DoES following social distancing. You can read [how we are keeping space acccess safe here](https://doesliverpool.com/press-releases/accessing-does-liverpool-during-covid-19/) and we will be setting up the event space appropriately.

Whatever happens we will provide online support if you want to do the course from home and will switch to full online video learning should restrictions and safety require it. Our top priority is to keep you safe so you can design more PCBs!

### Can I park nearby? 🚗🚌
There are a number of car parks within a 2 minute walk of DoES Liverpool, all around £3.50 for a whole day’s parking. See our [Wiki](https://github.com/DoESLiverpool/somebody-should/wiki/Location) page for details.

Alternatively, we’re a 10 minute walk, or 4 minute bike ride, from Lime Street Station, for those travelling by train.

### Are there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event? 🆔

This is a friendly professional course and open to all humans aged 18 and up.

### Is the venue wheelchair accessible? ♿

Yes! There’s level access into the Tapestry building, and then a lift up to DoES on the first floor. We have a large toilet suitable for wheelchairs, and the workshop is fully wheelchair accessible. If you have any accessibility needs, see our [Wiki here](https://github.com/DoESLiverpool/somebody-should/wiki/Accessibility), or drop us an email at the address below – we’re happy to help!
